# Level 3, Postman
This is about testing the previous projects from Postman.

Create two environments:

- Project Maven
- Project Gradle

Both environments will have two variables:

- Server, which in both cases will have the value http://localhost
- Port, which in the case of the Maven project will have the value 9000, and in the case of the Gradle project, 9002.



What do you have to deliver? (4 files):

- The two environments exported.
- A screenshot for each environment, where you can see the execution from Postman using the environment and the variables defined in them.

You can try the URL: http://localhost:xxxx/HelloWorld/elmeunom, or any other one supported by the two projects. (remember that for the execution to work correctly, you will need to have both projects running in Eclipse).

Runs from Eclipse the projects created in the previous two levels, and displays the return obtained in each project, when you call some of the available requests, using the created environments and their variables.

You will have to deliver two screenshots, one for the execution of each environment, and two files in JSON format, with the exported environments.
