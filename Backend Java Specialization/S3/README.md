# Sprint 3, Patterns
In this sprint we are meant to learn to identify and handle software design patterns.

This sprint is a bit of a mid-point and in that, there's different stages to it.

The first one, tasks one and two, are dedicated to learning about and practicing using patterns.

The second one, task three, is a team development of a simple application to teach and test our teamwork abilities.
