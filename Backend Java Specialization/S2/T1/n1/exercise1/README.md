# Assignment Summary
An optical store, called "Cul d'Ampolla", wants to computerize the management of customers and glasses sales.

First of all, the optician wants to know who is the supplier of each of the glasses. In particular, you want to know about each supplier:
- The name.
- The address (street, number, floor, door, city, postal code and country).
- Phone.
- Fax.
- NIF.

The optician's purchasing policy is that glasses of one brand will be bought from a single supplier (so you can get more good prices out of them), but they can buy glasses of several brands from one supplier. He wants to know about the glasses:
- The brand.
- The prescription of each of the glasses.
- The type of frame (floating, paste or metallic).
- The color of the frame.
- The color of each glass.
- The price.

Of the customers you want to store:
- The name.
- The postal address.
- The phone.
- The email.
- The registration date.
- When a new customer arrives, store the customer who has been recommended by the establishment (as long as someone has recommended it).
- Our system must indicate who was the employee who sold each pair of glasses.
