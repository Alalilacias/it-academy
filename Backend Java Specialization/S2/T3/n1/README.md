# Level instructions
For this level, we are told that an optical store, called "Cul d'Ampolla", wants to computerize the management of customers and glasses sales.

They want to keep track of:
- The supplier of each of the glasses. In particular, about each supplier:
  - Name
  - Address (street, number, floor, door, city, postal code and country)
  - Telephone
  - Fax
  - NIF.
- The glasses. In particular, about each glass:
  - The brand
  - The graduation of each of the glasses
  - The type of frame (floating, paste or metallic)
  - The color of the frame
  - The color of each glass, and
  - The price.
- The customers. In particular, about each customer:
  - Name
  - Postal address
  - Telephone
  - Email
  - Registration date.
- When a new customer arrives, store the customer who has been recommended by the establishment (as long as someone has recommended it).
- Our system must indicate who was the employee who sold each pair of glasses. Defines which day/time the sale takes place.

Taking into account this base information, each exercise will provide different conditions under which we'll have to design the database.
