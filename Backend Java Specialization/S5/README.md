# Sprint 5, Spring Framework Advanced
This sprint takes the concepts learnt in the previous one and makes us apply them in a more advanced setting, already guiding us towards the eventual final project of the course.

This sprint is separated in two parts, the first task, a series of more advanced Spring Boot exercises, and the second task, the final project of the course.
