# Summary of the course
The Backend Java Specialization is a free course imparted by the IT Academy, managed by the Generalitat de Catalunya, and subsidized by the European Union to foster the training of professional coders within its borders.

The modus operandi of the courses of the Academy allows the students access to teachers with deep knowledge and experience in the areas they teach, from which you can learn the best way not just to work but to learn while working in the IT sector.

The system includes classes, exercises, a tutor system, and an environment that simulates the one you'll find in the professional world. Enabling and forcing its students to learn not just to work under pressure but to gain the skills to socialize, work in groups and individually, and adapt to the circumstances as well as form the habits required to do so in the most efficient way possible.

The specialization is the final part of this process, where one gets put through a working cycle that requires learning new tools and applying them in an acceptable timetable while having your work evaluated not just by other students to foster inter-colleague work but also review work from a very early stage of learning.

In this folder, you'll find the exercises that the students are made to solve and brief explanations of them. While the level of the initial exercises might seem more that of a beginner, it's meant to be a progression, so looking at all of them gives you an idea of the growth of the student and the latest exercises give you a view of their current skills.

As per usual, feel free to contact the owner of this repository for any inquiries you might have.
