# Assignment Instructions
Create a list containing some strings of text and numbers.

Sort them by:
- Alphabetical order, taking into account the first character (Note: charAt(0) returns the numeric code of the first character)
- Strings containing an "e" first, other strings after. Put the code directly in the lambda.
- Modify all elements in the list that have an 'a'. Change the 'a' to a '4'.
- Show only items that are numeric. (Even if they are saved as Strings).
