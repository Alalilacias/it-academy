# Assignment Instructions
Create a Functional Interface that contains a method called reverse().

This method must receive and must return a String.

In the main() of the main class, it injects into the interface created using a lambda, the body of the method, so that it returns the same string that it receives as a parameter but in reverse.

Invoke an interface instance by passing it a string and checks if the result is correct.
