# Assignment Instructions
In a music group, there are different types of musical instruments. There are wind, string, and percussion instruments.

All instruments have their name and price as fields. Also, they have an abstract method called play(). Due to its abstract nature, it must be implemented in each subclass. If a wind instrument is being played, the method must print on the console: "A wind instrument is playing", if a string instrument is being played: "A string instrument is playing" and if a percussion instrument is being played: "A percussion instrument is playing".
