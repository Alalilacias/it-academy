# Assignment Instructions
Given the file countries.txt (check the resources section) that contains countries and capitals, the program must read the file and store the data in a HashMap<String, String>.

The program asks for the name of the user, and then it must show a random country, saved in the HashMap. It is about what the user has to write the name of the capital of the country in question. If they get it right, they get a point. This action is repeated 10 times. Once the capitals of 10 countries have been requested randomly, then the name of the user and their score must be saved in a file called Scores.txt.
