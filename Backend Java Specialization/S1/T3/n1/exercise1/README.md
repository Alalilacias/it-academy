# Assignment Instructions
Create a class called Month with a "name" field (which will store the name of the month of the year). Add 11 Month instances (each with a different attribute) to an ArrayList, except for the object with the "August" attribute. Then, perform the insertion in the place that corresponds to that month and show that the ArrayList maintains the correct order.

Convert the ArrayList into a HashSet and make sure it doesn't allow duplicates.

Iterate through the list with a for loop and an iterator.
