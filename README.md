# it-academy
Repository for the upload of the required exercises for the completion of the Java Backend course imparted at the IT Academy of Barcelona, under the supervision of the Generalitat de Catalunya and funded by the European Union.
It's main purpose is to practice the use of Git, and Github, the workflow of a possible future job, and allow the grading of the exercises required for the completion of the course.
It's access is intended in the first place for other students and professors at the Academy. In second place, as a repository of work, a show of work ethic, and a showcase of the evolution of the student. Last, but not least, for anybody for whom the contents should prove useful.
The owner is open to any inquiries, both theoretical, practical, and work-related. Feel free to contact them.
